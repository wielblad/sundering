**R - Eye of the Storm:**
- "QUIET NOW! THIS IS THE PEACEFUL PART! ISN'T IT PEACEFUL? I LOVE IT!"
- "THE CALM IN THE CENTER! WHERE STORIES LIVE! LET ME TELL YOU ONE!"

### Kill

- "Oh no! Your story ended! It was getting interesting!"
- "Sorry! That wasn't supposed to happen! Well, it WAS, but I'm still sorry!"
- "I'll remember your story! I remember EVERYONE'S story!"
- "You were brave! I'll tell people you were brave!"

### Death

- "But... I had more... stories... to collect..."
- "Tell them... the good ones... for me..."

### Respawn

- "I'M BACK! Did I miss any stories? Tell me EVERYTHING!"
- "Whoooosh! Part two! The sequel! Even better!"
- "The wind can't stay gone! Neither can I!"

### Taunt

- "I bet you're wondering how fast wind can hit! Want to find out? No? Too late!"
- "I've collected stories from everywhere! Want to hear how this one ends? Spoiler: you lose!"

## SCOURGE

*The Exiled Prince - Warrior*

> *"In hell, I had everything. Power. Dominion. Fear. But never once did I feel the absence of what humans call 'joy.' Now I feel the absence. It is worse than anything in the pit."*

### Hero Selection

- "I am Scourge. I was a prince of demons. Now I am... searching."
- "Select me if you wish. I no longer command. I request."
- "Exile has taught me what hell could not: want."
- "I join your cause. Perhaps in battle, I will finally feel... something."

### Movement

- "Each step in this world weighs differently. Why?"
- "Humans walk so carelessly. They do not know what they have."
- "I move through a world I do not understand. It is... uncomfortable."
- "The wind touches my skin. Is this what 'gentle' feels like?"

### Attack

- "Combat. The closest thing to feeling I know."
- "Strike!"
- "This is familiar. The only familiar thing."
- "Violence I understand. It is everything else that confuses me."

### Ability Cast

**Q - Hellfire Slash:**
- "Fire from home. It means nothing now."
- "A gift from the pit."

**W - Demon's Resolve:**
- "Pain. I know pain. This is almost comforting."
- "Suffering is familiar."

**E - Infernal Charge:**
- "Let me feel the impact!"
- "Collision. Contact. Something."

**R - Prince of the Pit:**
- "REMEMBER WHAT I WAS! REMEMBER WHAT I GAVE UP TO FEEL!"
- "I WAS A PRINCE OF HELL! NOW I AM... LEARNING! AND IT IS AGONY!"

### Kill

- "You felt fear before the end. I... envied that."
- "Was that satisfaction? No. Just memory of what satisfaction might be."
- "You are gone. I felt nothing. As always."
- "Perhaps the next one will make me feel something."

### Death

- "Is this... relief? Or just... ending?"
- "The pit calls... I will not... answer..."
- "I almost... felt something... at the end..."

### Respawn

- "Returned. Still empty. Still searching."
- "I cannot die until I have felt what living means."
- "Back. The search for feeling continues."

### Taunt

- "I ruled over suffering. Yours would have been unremarkable."
- "In hell, I tortured souls for eternity. You are not impressive."
- "Fight me. Perhaps your desperation will teach me fear."

### Special Interactions

**To Ironclad:**
- "You feel too much and wish to feel less. I feel nothing and wish to feel anything. We are both cursed."

**To Valeria:**
- "Your Light burns. But it also warms. I have never felt warm. May I... stand closer?"

**To Grimjaw:**
- "You wear my kind as trophies. I should hate you. I wish I could hate you."

# CROSS-FACTION LEGENDARY INTERACTIONS

*Special lines that trigger when specific heroes from opposing factions meet.*

---

## Sylara vs. Thornweaver (The Broken Bond)

**Sylara to Thornweaver:**
- "We grew from the same soil, old friend. Must we water it with blood?"
- "Eight hundred years of wisdom, and you learned only hate. I grieve for what you've become."
- "I did not betray the forest. I extended its mercy to those who needed it."

**Thornweaver to Sylara:**
- "You speak of mercy while standing beside axe-wielders and fire-bringers. Hypocrite."
- "We were saplings together. You chose to grow toward human warmth. You will burn for it."
- "Every human you heal is another tree that will fall. Your kindness is murder."

---

## Pyralis vs. Frostborne (Fire and Ice)

**Pyralis to Frostborne:**
- "You're like me! But opposite! And sad! So much SAD! Can I fix you?"
- "I could warm you up! Just a little? The edges? Please?"
- "You were human! What was it like? I've always wanted to know!"

**Frostborne to Pyralis:**
- "Stay away. Your warmth is... painful. In ways you cannot understand."
- "I was human. I felt warmth. Now your fire only reminds me what I've lost."
- "We are opposites. Let us remain apart. Some elements should not mix."

---

## Hex vs. Pyralis (The Burned and the Burning)

**Hex to Pyralis:**
- "Do you know what your kind did to me? Three times? Keep your distance, spark."
- "Oh look, living fire. My favorite thing. Right after plague and betrayal."
- "Fascinating. A fire elemental. I'm sure we'll be GREAT friends."

**Pyralis to Hex:**
- "Oh no! You're the burned one! I'm so sorry! I didn't do it! Other fire did it! Bad fire!"
- "I would never burn you on purpose! Fire should be happy! Yours wasn't happy!"
- "Can I... can I see your scars? I want to understand what bad fire does."

---

## Valeria vs. Scourge (Light and Darkness)

**Valeria to Scourge:**
- "A demon seeking redemption walks the same path as any sinner. The Light judges deeds, not origins."
- "You wish to feel? Faith brings peace. Perhaps it could bring you something."
- "My mother would have tried to save even you. I will honor her example."

**Scourge to Valeria:**
- "Your Light... it does not burn like other holy power. Why?"
- "You seek your mother. I seek feeling. We are both lost. There is... comfort in that."
- "Teach me about faith. I wish to understand why it makes you feel so much."

---

## Grimjaw vs. Scourge (The Hunter and the Hunted)

**Grimjaw to Scourge:**
- "Another demon! Grimjaw already have jaw. But always room for more trophies!"
- "You not like other demons. Other demons fight. You... think. Grimjaw confused."
- "Why demon look so sad? Demon things not usually sad."

**Scourge to Grimjaw:**
- "You wear my former subjects as decorations. I should destroy you. Why do I not want to?"
- "The demon whose jaw you wear was called Maz'goth. He feared nothing. You must be... formidable."
- "Is that what 'pride' feels like? When you wear your kills? Teach me."

---

## Vex vs. Nightshade (Shadow Dancers)

**Vex to Nightshade:**
- "Another shadow walker. The slums had plenty. You're not special."
- "I kill for revenge. Why do you kill? Does it matter?"
- "Stay out of my way, phantom. These targets are mine."

**Nightshade to Vex:**
- "Noise. You make too much noise."
- "You kill with venom. I kill with silence. There is room for both."
- "...pain. I see pain in you. It is... familiar."

---

## Bladewarden vs. Scourge (The Performers)

**Bladewarden to Scourge:**
- "You want to feel? Try the arena. Nothing makes you feel more alive than almost dying."
- "A demon prince, fighting for mortals. The crowd would have loved your story."
- "Grace says to help you. Vengeance says to watch you closely. I'll do both."

**Scourge to Bladewarden:**
- "You carry guilt like I carry emptiness. Heavy. Everywhere. I understand."
- "The crowd gave you purpose. I had power. Neither fills the void."
- "Tell me about 'thrill.' The arena gave you thrill. What did that feel like?"

---

## Zephyr vs. Nightshade (The Collector and the Silent)

**Zephyr to Nightshade:**
- "SO. MANY. STORIES! You've lived SO long! You've seen SO much! TELL ME EVERYTHING!"
- "Your silence has stories too! The best stories are in what people DON'T say!"
- "I'll trade you! I tell you a story, you tell me a story! Deal? Deal! I'm starting!"

**Nightshade to Zephyr:**
- *long pause* "...you talk too much." *another pause* "...I do not hate it."
- "Stories. I have... one. Perhaps. When the battle ends."
- "You collect stories. I collect silences. Opposites." *the faintest hint of warmth*

## Implementation Notes

1. **Voice Direction**: Each hero's lines should be recorded with distinct vocal characteristics:
   - Ironclad: Deep, weary, with poetic pauses
   - Grimjaw: Rough, simple, powerful
   - Sylara: Ethereal, measured, mysterious
   - Frostborne: Echo effect, hollow, distant
   - Pyralis: Crackling undertone, energetic, curious
   - Nightshade: Whispered, minimal, occasional silence as response

2. **Trigger Priority**: Special interactions should override generic lines when applicable heroes meet.

3. **Frequency Weights**: Death and respawn lines should have lower repetition tolerance than movement lines.

4. **Localization Note**: Grimjaw's broken English should be adapted thoughtfully for other languages to maintain the "simple warrior" characterization without being offensive.
